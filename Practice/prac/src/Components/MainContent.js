       will come to your Dreams HOOHOHOHOHOHO, Just like he came in my 100-Legs(Zohaib) friend Dreams".
       The kids did not listen to Mr.Sameer and after that Atif Mehde realy did came to their Dreams and 
       said,"Astaghfirullah Astaghfirullah Astaghfirullahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh". After that the kids where not 
       able to sleep for at least 10-days, and in that day they learn they should delete the heap memory
